<p>This is the API of Hyper Graph Explorer (HGE) software.</p>

<p>HGE is a 100% pure Java software implementing a data modeling system relying on an hyper-graph.</p>

<H3>Main Features</H3>
<p>It contains the following main features:</br></br>
- a hierarchical data modeling system used to describe real data</br>
- a data topology representation relying on a hyper-graph</br>
- a query system enabling to explore the data graph using hyper-graph queries</br>
</p>

<H3>Main Packages</H3>
<p>These features are implemented with the following packages:</br></br>
- "datamodel" package: use it to describe your real data. The data modeling scheme relies on a hyper-graph: 
data elements are nodes (or vertices) that are linked together using hyper-edges. The latter offers the advantage 
of representing n-ary relations (n>1). So, a "datamodel" is a hyper-graph of "types".</br>

- "hypergraph" package: use it to represent the real data as an hyper-graph. So, this is the real world graph, where
vertices and hyper-edges are typed with the data model.</br>

- "query" package: use it to setup and run hyper-graph queries. It is worth noting that the query 
execution engine implements a method to solve the subgraph isomorphism problem in the context of an hyper-graph 
containing data types and values.</br> 

- "function" package: provides a way to implement custom-made manipulation of data. Functions are then used 
by their name in a query.</br> 

- Other packages are support codes to implement the entire system, mostly the query language parser/validator 
and the query execution engine.</br> 
</p>

<H3>HGE: how to use it with real data?</H3>

<p>HGE does not know any particular data models. To use the system you have to implement the interfaces of 
packages "datamodel" and "hypergraph".</p> 

<p>You can review a real example by getting a look at the [Blast Filter Tool](https://github.com/pgdurand/BLAST-Filter-Tool) project: 
it provides an implementation of HGE to deal with annotated [BLAST](https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi) results data model; this is an 
application of HGE in the field of bioinformatics.</p>
