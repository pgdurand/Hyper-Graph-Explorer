<p>The "query" package is used it to setup and run hyper-graph queries.</p>

<h3>How to setup a query?</h3>
<p>Create a new query instance by calling: {@link bzh.plealog.hge.api.query.HGEManager#newHQuery()}. This returns a new
{@link bzh.plealog.hge.api.query.HGEQuery} instance. Then, you can add constraints on this instance.</p>

<h3>How to run a query?</h3>
<p>Simply call the method execute(DataGraphModel,HDataGraph) on the HGEQuery instance.</p>

<h3>How does it work?</h3>
<p>The query 
execution engine implements a method to solve the subgraph isomorphism problem in the context of an hyper-graph 
containing data types and values.</p>
