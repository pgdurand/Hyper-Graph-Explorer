<p>The "datamodel" package provides the interfaces to describe real world data as an hyper-graph.</p>

<p>Actually, the idea of an hyper-graph is here very shallow. It mostly means that you'll have to describe 
your data using a {@link bzh.plealog.hge.api.datamodel.DataGraphModel} that is made of 
{@link bzh.plealog.hge.api.datamodel.DGMVertexType} and {@link bzh.plealog.hge.api.datamodel.DGMHyperEdgeType}, each of 
them containing some {@link bzh.plealog.hge.api.datamodel.DGMAttribute}.</p>

<p>{@link bzh.plealog.hge.api.datamodel.DGMVertexType} and {@link bzh.plealog.hge.api.datamodel.DGMHyperEdgeType} can be organized using hierarchies (types and sub-types). This hierarchical
data model only support single inheritance.</p>
