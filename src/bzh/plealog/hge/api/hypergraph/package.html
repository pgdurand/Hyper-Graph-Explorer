<p>The "hypergraph" package provides the interfaces to describe the topology of the data as an hyper-graph.</p>

<h3>Describing the graph topology</h3>
<p>Here, we are really in the core of the system: {@link bzh.plealog.hge.api.hypergraph.HDataGraph} (a Hyper-graph) is made of 
{@link bzh.plealog.hge.api.hypergraph.HDGVertex} and {@link bzh.plealog.hge.api.hypergraph.HDGHyperEdge} that 
are connected through {@link bzh.plealog.hge.api.hypergraph.HDGLink}. {@link bzh.plealog.hge.api.hypergraph.HDGVertex} 
and {@link bzh.plealog.hge.api.hypergraph.HDGHyperEdge} contain {@link bzh.plealog.hge.api.hypergraph.HDGDataObject}.
</p>
<h3>Creating the graph from a real data source</h3>
<p>
A {@link bzh.plealog.hge.api.hypergraph.HDataGraph} is created using a {@link bzh.plealog.hge.api.hypergraph.HDBConnector} 
that is capable of reading a real source of data and convert it into such an hyper-graph.</p>
